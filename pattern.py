    else:

# That was a very difficult task, it took me two days to complete.
# Every single task before I've completed in about 30 minutes. I just couldn't figure out how to this.
# I enjoyed my time fighting this task. It gave me a lot of satisfaction, when it finally worked,
# I like when tasks are difficult like that. I still can't belive it worked :D .
# I've spent like 5 hours on just this task during those two days.
